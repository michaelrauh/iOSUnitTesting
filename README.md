# iOSUnitTesting

A demonstration of some unit testing patterns in Swift 3

## Installation
pod install

## Ideas in the app
  * Testing view controllers by loading from the storyboard
  * Wrapping system functions to make them testable
  * Usage of Alamofire, ObjectMapper, and AlamofireObjectMapper
  * Usage of generics and associated types
  * Testing actions by calling that action on an outlet
  * MVVM pattern
  * Singleton pattern in swift
  * Mocking with Moxie
  * Providing default implementations for some but not all protocol methods
  * Leveraging the delegate pattern for HTTP calls

## Todo
  * Demonstrate testing protocol extensions via a tame class pattern
  * Demonstrate extending base types, such as Int
  * Demonstrate global handling of errors (there is a place for this but no functionality)
  * Fix callback tests to use argument captors

## Concepts purposely ignored
  * Layout
  * Colors
  * Anything to do with the storyboard
